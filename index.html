<p style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:28;">He was born on 11 October 1937 in New Mexico.He is a famous computer scientist.He has two daughters and a son.<a href="http://community.fansshare.net/pic103/w/jack-elton-bresenham/1200/21427_bresenham.jpg"target="_blank"> Bresenham</a> who is well known about computer graphics by most people discovered line algorithm.When he worked at IBM in 1962,he developed the algorithm.After 27 years of service, he retired from at IBM.Also he worked 16 years at Winthrop University as a prelector and has nine patents.Bresenham’s line algorithm were developed for accurate drawing on the computer screen. The algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms discovered in the scope of computer graphics .It includes Plus,Minus and Times by 2 with integer for this reason<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Line_1.5x%2B1.svg"target="_blank"> Bresenham’s algorithm </a>is a highly efficient algorithm.Furthermore this algorithm is used for heart surgery  in hospitals.Finally,the Mitpoint circle algorithm and his line algorithm have some smilarities and Mitpoint circle algorithm is called as Brensham’s algorithm circle.
